# skladka documentation

{{< figure src="../images/crumpled-paper.svg" width="300px" >}}

this documentation is autogenerated from [godoc](https://go.dev/blog/godoc), converted to markdown using [gomarkdoc](https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc) and then rendered using [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

the structure reflects the package structure of the codebase and only exported types, functions and methods are included

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  some documentation has been ai generated as I wanted to get something out and then iterate on it, so there might be some weird sentences or useless/obvious information here and there
{{< /callout >}}

there are still small things here and there that I want to tackle, namely
* code blocks without proper syntax
* index not working
* edit on github button pointing to rendered markdown file instead of source file
* examples not integrated like I'd like to
* weird nesting on table of contents based on return type
* weird search results
